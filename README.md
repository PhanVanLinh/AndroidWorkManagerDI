"# AndroidWorkManagerDI" 

An example follow tutorial from here https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack#workmanager

- Remember to full fill dependencies of both hilt dagger and hilt work
- Also remember to add the provider into manifest
  > Because this customizes the WorkManager configuration, you also must remove the default initializer from the AndroidManifest.xml
